# forecast.solar - Hubitat -  DEPRECATED
Hubitat driver to retrieve a solar production estimate using the public API from forecast.solar

I did not find this API to be very accurate, so I switched over to Solcast. Check out the new driver [here](https://github.com/ke7lvb/Solcast)

# Setup Instructions:
1. Install the driver
2. Create a virtual device
3. Assign the Forecast.Solar driver
4. Fill in the device Preferences
5. Save Preferences
6. Click the Refresh command
7. (optional) Refresh the page to see the raw data
